	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

		<h2> The Game </h2>
		<p>This memory game is super fun and exciting like nothing you've played before. You'll get addicted before you know it. I'm not much of a games person, but even I got hooked to this.
